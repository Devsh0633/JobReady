    title: 'Cleared Amazon SDE-1 Interview! My Experience',
    body: 'Just wanted to share my experience clearing the Amazon SDE-1 interview as a fresher. I was rejected twice last year, so this round felt very high-stakes. The OA was tough but standard – DP, arrays, and a greedy question. In the virtual rounds they focused a lot on writing clean code, explaining trade-offs, and Amazon Leadership Principles. I made sure to speak through my thought process, even when I was stuck. In the final round they asked mostly behavioral questions about ownership and dealing with failure. Happy to answer questions or review someone’s prep plan if it helps.',

    title: 'How to answer "Why should we hire you?" for Sales roles?',
    body: 'I always freeze when the interviewer asks “Why should we hire you?” for sales roles. Earlier I used to repeat my resume or say generic things like “I’m hardworking.” Recently I changed my answer to a more structured one: 1) show that I understand their customers, 2) connect my experience to real outcomes, and 3) end with confidence but not arrogance. For example, I mention how I hit 132% of my target in my last internship by improving follow-up cadences. Then I tie that to their product and ICP. Would love feedback on this approach or examples that worked for you.',

    body: 'Here is my draft answer for “Tell me about a time you failed” for mechanical/core interviews. In my final year project I underestimated the time needed for testing and our prototype failed during the first demo because of a small design mistake in the mounting. I owned the mistake, stayed late with the team to redesign the part, and we ran proper validation before the next review. In the interview I focus on what I learnt: planning buffer time, doing quick FMEA, and communicating risks early. Does this sound honest and mature enough, or should I tone it down?',
