Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (/Users/apple/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/new_project/android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (/Users/apple/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/new_project/android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.

Warning: The plugin path_provider_android requires Android SDK version 36 or higher.

Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 34, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- record_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- url_launcher_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- webview_flutter_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /Users/apple/.gemini/antigravity/scratch/new_project/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }

       1.  Dependency 'androidx.browser:browser:1.9.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-34.

           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 36, for example 36.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
           minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
           on).

       2.  Dependency 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.17.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 36 or later of the
